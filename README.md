# Data-Cleaning-and-Visualization-ind-Excel

This time it's an small poject.<br>
We will clean data in Excel and visualize it as a dashboard.<br>

This project is structured in three parts:
1. Data Cleaning
2. Creating PivotTables
3. Building Dashboard

## Data Cleaning
In this part, we look for data which is messy or not correct and clean it up.<br>
To be more precise: We looking for:
- Data that is hard to understand
- A Way to better understand the Data
- Duplicates
- Spelling Mistakes
- trash data
- etc.

## Creating PivotTables
PivotTables in Excel helps us to find the data, that we want. It's like Data Exploration if you ask me.<br>
We create three PivotTables:
- Average Income Per Purchase
- Customer Commute
- Customer Age Brackets

We will us this PivotTables for our Visualizations.

## Building Dashboard
Now we gonna do the fun part. We build the Dashboard.<br>
For the charts we gonna use the Data from our PivotTables and we gonna add some Filters to make this Dashboard interactiv.
